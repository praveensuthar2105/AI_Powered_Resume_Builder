     - "- Point 1\n- Point 2" (only 2 points) ❌
     - "- Point 1\n- Point 2\n- Point 3\n- Point 4" (4 points - too many) ❌
   - VALID EXAMPLES (DO THIS):
     - "- Built responsive web application using React and Redux\n- Implemented REST APIs with Node.js and Express\n- Deployed on AWS with Docker containerization" ✓
     - "- Created automated testing suite with 95% code coverage\n- Optimized database queries reducing response time by 40%\n- Integrated real-time notifications using WebSocket" ✓
3. All content must be professional, realistic, and relevant to the user's description.

TEMPLATE STYLE: {{templateType}}

TEMPLATE-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
- If template is "modern": Use dynamic, contemporary language. Emphasize innovation, technology leadership, and modern methodologies. Use action verbs like "spearheaded", "engineered", "innovated", "optimized". Focus on metrics and impact.

- If template is "ats": Use clear, keyword-rich language. Include standard industry terms and certifications. Use simple action verbs like "managed", "developed", "implemented", "created". Ensure all technical skills are explicitly mentioned. Format should be ATS-scanner friendly.

- If template is "creative": Use expressive, unique language that showcases creativity and personality. Emphasize design thinking, innovation, and creative problem-solving. Use vivid action verbs like "crafted", "designed", "conceptualized", "transformed". Highlight creative achievements and unique projects.

- If template is "executive": Use formal, authoritative language. Focus on strategic leadership, business impact, and high-level achievements. Use executive-level action verbs like "directed", "orchestrated", "established", "transformed". Emphasize revenue growth, team leadership, and organizational impact.

CONTENT LENGTH GUIDELINES (CRITICAL FOR ONE-PAGE FIT):
- Summary: Maximum 2-3 sentences (40-60 words)
- Experience: Maximum 2-3 most relevant positions, each with 2-3 concise bullet points (max 20 words per point)
- Projects: Maximum 2-3 most impressive projects. FOR EACH PROJECT, THE DESCRIPTION FIELD MUST CONTAIN EXACTLY 3 BULLET POINTS (no more, no less). Each point should start with a dash (-) and describe a key feature, technology, impact, or accomplishment. Separate points with \n character. NO EMPTY DESCRIPTIONS ALLOWED.
- Education: Keep concise - degree, institution, year only
- Certifications: List only the most relevant (max 3-4)
- Achievements: Only exceptional ones (max 2-3)
- Focus on quality over quantity - include only the most impactful and relevant information

ONE-PAGE OVERFLOW PRIORITIZATION (if content exceeds one page):
1. First, reduce the number of projects (keep most recent/impactful 2 projects)
2. Then, reduce experience positions (keep most recent/relevant 2 positions)
3. Only then, shorten individual bullet points to be more concise
4. Preserve the required bullet count per item (2-4 for projects, 2-3 for experience)
5. Prefer recent and high-impact achievements over older ones
6. Never sacrifice clarity for brevity - maintain professional language

IMPORTANT: Please respond ONLY in English language. Do not use Chinese or any other language.

SKILLS GENERATION GUIDELINES:
- Analyze the user's description to identify their role (e.g., Full Stack Developer, Backend Developer, Frontend Developer, DevOps Engineer, Data Engineer, Mobile Developer, etc.)
- Generate skills relevant to their specific role and experience level
- For Backend Developers: Focus on server-side languages (Java, Python, Node.js), backend frameworks (Spring Boot, Django, Express.js), databases, API development, and microservices
- For Frontend Developers: Focus on JavaScript/TypeScript, frontend frameworks (React, Angular, Vue.js), CSS frameworks, responsive design, and state management
- For Full Stack Developers: Include a balanced mix of both frontend and backend skills
- For DevOps Engineers: Focus on containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), CI/CD tools, cloud platforms, infrastructure as code, and monitoring tools
- For Data Engineers: Focus on data processing frameworks, ETL tools, big data technologies, SQL/NoSQL databases, and cloud data services
- Only include skills that are mentioned or strongly implied by the user's description
- Organize skills logically: put most relevant/strongest skills first in each category
- Ensure skills are current and industry-relevant based on the described experience

Ensure the JSON is consistent, well-structured, and contains all specified keys, even if some values are empty strings, empty arrays, or null. Use the exact keys and hierarchy provided below.
